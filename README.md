## About The Project

In this repo, I will be exploring creative coding and coding art. Some of these projects will also serve as studies in manipulating elements on the html canvas.
<br/>
<br/>

### Built With

These projects and studies have been built with:

- HTML canvas
- JavaScript
- Canvas Sketch

<br/>

## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

<br/>

### Installation

To get started, clone the repository to your local environment.

In the folder titled "sketches" you will want to run `npm i` to install the necessary dependancies.

## Usage

Feel free to use this in your own projects or just to explore creative coding!
